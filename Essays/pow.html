    <h1>Charisma / Power</h1> <br>
    January 2017<br><br>People who are powerful but uncharismatic will tend to be disliked.
    Their power makes them a target for criticism that they don't have
    the charisma to disarm. That was Hillary Clinton's problem. It also
    tends to be a problem for any CEO who is more of a builder than a
    schmoozer. And yet the builder-type CEO is (like Hillary) probably
    the best person for the job.<br><br>I don't think there is any solution to this problem. It's human
    nature. The best we can do is to recognize that it's happening, and
    to understand that being a magnet for criticism is sometimes a sign
    not that someone is the wrong person for a job, but that they're
    the right one.
