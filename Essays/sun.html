    <h1>General and Surprising</h1> <br>
  September 2017<br><br>The most valuable insights are both general and surprising.
  F&nbsp;=&nbsp;ma for example. But general and surprising is a hard
  combination to achieve. That territory tends to be picked
  clean, precisely because those insights are so valuable.<br><br>Ordinarily, the best that people can do is one without the
  other: either surprising without being general (e.g.
  gossip), or general without being surprising (e.g.
  platitudes).<br><br>Where things get interesting is the moderately valuable
  insights.  You get those from small additions of whichever
  quality was missing.  The more common case is a small
  addition of generality: a piece of gossip that's more than
  just gossip, because it teaches something interesting about
  the world. But another less common approach is to focus on
  the most general ideas and see if you can find something new
  to say about them. Because these start out so general, you
  only need a small delta of novelty to produce a useful
  insight.<br><br>A small delta of novelty is all you'll be able to get most
  of the time. Which means if you take this route, your ideas
  will seem a lot like ones that already exist. Sometimes
  you'll find you've merely rediscovered an idea that did
  already exist.  But don't be discouraged.  Remember the huge
  multiplier that kicks in when you do manage to think of
  something even a little new.<br><br>Corollary: the more general the ideas you're talking about,
  the less you should worry about repeating yourself.  If you
  write enough, it's inevitable you will.  Your brain is much
  the same from year to year and so are the stimuli that hit
  it. I feel slightly bad when I find I've said something
  close to what I've said before, as if I were plagiarizing
  myself. But rationally one shouldn't.  You won't say
  something exactly the same way the second time, and that
  variation increases the chance you'll get that tiny but
  critical delta of novelty.<br><br>And of course, ideas beget ideas.  (That sounds familiar.)
  An idea with a small amount of novelty could lead to one
  with more. But only if you keep going. So it's doubly
  important not to let yourself be discouraged by people who
  say there's not much new about something you've discovered.
  "Not much new" is a real achievement when you're talking
  about the most general ideas. <!-- Maybe if you keep going,
  you'll discover more. --><br><br>It's not true that there's nothing new under the sun.  There
  are some domains where there's almost nothing new.  But
  there's a big difference between nothing and almost nothing,
  when it's multiplied by the area under the sun.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
