    <h1>This Year We Can End the Death Penalty in California</h1> <br>
    November 2016<br><br>If you're a California voter, there is an important proposition
    on your ballot this year: Proposition 62, which bans the death
    penalty.<br><br>When I was younger I used to think the debate about the death
    penalty was about when it's ok to take a human life.  Is it ok
    to kill a killer?<br><br>But that is not the issue here.<br><br>The real world does not work like the version I was shown on TV growing up.  The police
    often arrest the wrong person.
    Defendants' lawyers are often incompetent.  And prosecutors
    are often motivated more by publicity than justice.<br><br>In the real world,
    <a href="http://time.com/79572/more-innocent-people-on-death-row-than-estimated-study/"><u>about 4%</u></a> of people sentenced to death
    are innocent.
    So this is not about whether it's ok to kill killers. This
    is about whether it's ok to kill innocent people.<br><br>A child could answer that one for you.<br><br>This year, in California, you have a chance to end this, by
    voting yes on Proposition 62. But beware, because there is another
    proposition, Proposition 66, whose goal is to make it
    easier to execute people. So yes on 62, no on 66.<br><br>It's time.
