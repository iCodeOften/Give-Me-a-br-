    <h1>The Risk of Discovery</h1> <br>
    Because biographies of famous scientists tend to
    edit out their mistakes, we underestimate the
    degree of risk they were willing to take.
    And because anything a famous scientist did that
    wasn't a mistake has probably now become the
    conventional wisdom, those choices don't
    seem risky either.<br><br>Biographies of Newton, for example, understandably focus
    more on physics than alchemy or theology.
    The impression we get is that his unerring judgment
    led him straight to truths no one else had noticed.
    How to explain all the time he spent on alchemy
    and theology?  Well, smart people are often kind of
    crazy.<br><br>But maybe there is a simpler explanation. Maybe
    the smartness and the craziness were not as separate
    as we think. Physics seems to us a promising thing
    to work on, and alchemy and theology obvious wastes
    of time. But that's because we know how things
    turned out. In Newton's day the three problems
    seemed roughly equally promising. No one knew yet
    what the payoff would be for inventing what we
    now call physics; if they had, more people would
    have been working on it. And alchemy and theology
    were still then in the category Marc Andreessen would
    describe as "huge, if true."<br><br>Newton made three bets. One of them worked. But
    they were all risky.
