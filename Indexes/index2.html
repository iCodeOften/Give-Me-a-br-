    <h1>12 August 1995: It Works</h1> <br>
	These emails are from the day we got Viaweb working.  I think
we demoed it to potential investors a few days later.<br><br><!-- In 1995, what are now called online stores were usually called
"catalogs."  We made a conscious decision to switch to the word
"store" in December, guessing (correctly) that a shorter name would
win. --><br><br><font face=courier>

Cc: pg, rtm<br><br>About an hour ago we got the generator working remotely.  That
is, you can now run the generator at our site from Netscape,
wherever you happen to be.<br><br>--> If you were a catalog company, yesterday there were about five
    places that could generate a web catalog for you.  Now anyone
    with a modem and a copy of Netscape can do it.<br><br>To use the program, all you have to do is go to a certain URL
at www.webgen.com.  This page has a form you can type commands
into to run the generator.  When it has finished, you can inspect
your changed catalog by going to its URL.<br><br>We now have to do a lot of polishing: the program is very slow
and not especially user-friendly.  But it is a real, working system,
and it already generates the best catalogs on the Web.<br><br>We are thinking of having the service go online for real around
the beginning of September.  Between now and then we might like
to use you as a guinea-pig, Gino.  Actually, we should have
Julian generate a catalog of his own, too.
